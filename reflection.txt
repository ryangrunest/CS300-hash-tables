The purpose of HashTable is to implement a hash table data structure for efficiently storing, retrieving, and managing bid data. The hash table uses chaining to handle collisions, ensuring that multiple bids with the same hash key can be stored in linked lists within the same bucket. The program provides functionality to insert bids, search for bids by their unique ID, remove bids, and display all bids.

To solve the problem of collisions, the hash table employs a chaining technique, where each bucket contains a linked list of nodes. This ensures that even when multiple keys hash to the same bucket, all associated bids can still be stored and accessed. Challenges encountered include managing memory for dynamically allocated nodes and ensuring proper traversal and deletion of nodes in the linked lists. These challenges are addressed by implementing the destructor to free memory and by using traversal logic in methods like Insert, Remove, and Search. The program uses a hash function to distribute keys evenly across buckets, minimizing collisions and improving performance.
